			<p class="model-info__desc">The smoking pipe is made of black limestone and it has a
			zig-zag pattern. The zig-zag pattern can be representive of the mountains. This pipe can be used by either a medicine man or woman. Smaller pipes are usually used by women because they have a smaller bowl. The one hole that is drilled through the bottom ridge can represent which tribe they belong to. The lip around the top of the bowl is also uncommon for pipes.  The pipe was funded by Christy Fund and was purchased from William Wareham in Britain. The pipe was excavated in Marietta, USA.</p>
