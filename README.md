# DynamicWebAssign2

Our group object was a smoking pipe and our concept behind our design was to make the site focus mainly on the object itself. 
The first thing you see when you enter our site is a dark and foggy environment and then our object appears through the fog.
The fog is supposed to represent smoke from the pipe. Users can move around the object to see every detail of the pipe. 
There is an ‘INFO’ button on the bottom of the screen that users can click, and it will take them to another page with all the information about our smoking pipe. 
Our object is from 1882 and it was excavated in Marietta, USA. The pipe itself is made from limestone and it has a zig-zag pattern on the bowl. 
The pipe also has a hole through the bottom of the bowl and that can represent what tribe they are from.

For this project we used A-Frame to display our object and help create our environment.
A-Frame also helped us use controls and cameras to get our object to move and create that perfect lighting. 
The Smoking Pipe is property of the Blackfoot People and displayed on the Blackfoot Digital Library.
